Design Challenge
------
For this project, we were tasked with creating a story world.
We wanted to create a story set in a classic and familiar setting. We decided on a Romeo and Juliet-type serenade situation after considering several famous children's stories and literary stories.

**Role:** Designer / Technical Artist<br>
**Duration:** 2 weeks<br>
**Platform:** HTC Vive + controllers<br>
**Tools:** Unity<br>



Narrative
------
Inspired by a Romeo-and-Juliet-esque balcony serenade, our narrative was a three-part scene that climaxed with a twist. We designed three different scripted interactions, one for each part.

_**[Act 0 - Introduction]**_<br>
The guest will find themselves in the garden, where the Princess is reading on the balcony. The frog statue magically comes to life, and tells them that he, Don Toadlioni, will aid them in wooing the Princess.<br>
_**[Act 1 - Violin]**_<br>
Don Toadlioni, in a fairy frog-father style, gives the guest a violin and bow. The guest can then play the violin and the Princess will react. The Competitor appears just as the guest starts to sound good, and Don Toadlioni urges the guest to play harder. The violin will break shortly after.<br>
_**[Act 2 - Juggling]**_<br>
Don Toadlioni quickly suggests juggling instead of trying to play the broken violin, and swaps out the violin for juggling balls. The guest can then move their hands up and down, and the balls appear to be juggled. However, the Competitor, upon seeing this, begins to juggle even more balls than the guest.<br>
_**[Act 3 - Singing and Climax]**_<br>
Don Toadlioni is at wit's end, and provides a final suggestion - sing to win the Princess's heart. The guest is given a microphone with which to sing, and the Princess starts to come down from her balcony with a rose.<br>
_**[Act 4 - Ending]**_<br>
The Princess snuffs the guest and walks towards the Competitor, presenting the rose to him. However, all this while, the Competitor doesn't take his eyes off the guest. The Competitor snatches the rose from the Princess, and presents it to the guest, saying that their singing has won his heart.
