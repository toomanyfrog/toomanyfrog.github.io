Used Python scripts to model, rig, and animate assets for Space Bar, a VR bartending experience.
Wrote shader to animate the texture on liquid flow as well as projection on the bar walls.

Scripted this anemone-lamp model by duplicating, repeating, and deforming.

The shader to scroll textures on an image was used on the wall projection as well as the soda-gun, as can be seen in the following videos:
