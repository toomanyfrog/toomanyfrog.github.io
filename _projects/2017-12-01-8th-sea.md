<b>Contributions</b><br>

- Designed game mechanics in a multi-disciplinary team
- Scripted rhythm game and tutorial system
- Conceptualized and scripted VR beatmap maker
- Conducted playtests
With this project, we set out to create a rhythm game along the lines of Beat Saber, but using punching and kicking instead of slicing as the core mechanic. We were also given a wireless HTC Vive headset that allowed us to create beat patterns that would let players rotate in 360 degrees.
